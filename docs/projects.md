## Design Project \#1 (CMG)

### The system

The first project that you will complete this semester is to design, implement, and test a controller that uses a single-gimbal control moment gyroscope (CMG) to reorient a platform in a gravitational field, as pictured below:

![Image of control moment gyroscope](./images/cmg.png)

This system has three parts:

* A *platform* (dark blue) that can rotate freely about its base. Think of this as a spacecraft that is confined to rotate about its pitch axis, as if it were being tested on the ground.
* A *gimbal* (light blue) that can be driven by a motor to rotate about a perpendicular axis with respect to the platform.
* A *rotor* (orange) that can be driven by a motor to spin about yet another perpendicular axis with respect to the gimbal.

If the rotor is spun at a high rate, then an "input torque" applied to the gimbal will, through conservation of angular momentum, result in an "output torque" applied to the platform. This output torque can be used, in particular, to change the orientation of the platform.

One advantage of using a single-gimbal CMG over a reaction wheel is that this output torque can be much higher than the input torque --- a so-called "torque amplification" effect. One disadvantage of using a CMG is that the resulting dynamics are more complicated and require a more sophisticated controller.

You can read more about CMGs and their use for spacecraft attitude control in [Fundamentals of Spacecraft Attitude Determination and Control (Markley and Crassidis, 2014)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-0802-8).

The motion of the system is governed by the following ordinary differential equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{q}_1 &= \dfrac{a_1 \sin(2q_2) \dot{q}_1\dot{q}_2 + a_2\cos(q_2)\dot{q}_2v_\text{rotor} + a_3\sin(q_1)}{a_4 + a_5\cos^2(q_2)} \\[1em]
\ddot{q}_2 &= a_6 \sin(2q_2)\dot{q}_1^2 + a_7\cos(q_2)\dot{q}_1v_\text{rotor} + a_8\tau
\end{aligned}
$$

In these equations, the following variables are functions of time:

* $q_1$ and $\dot{q}_1$ are the angle (rad) and angular velocity (rad/s) of the platform
* $q_2$ and $\dot{q}_2$ are the angle (rad) and angular velocity (rad/s) of the gimbal
* $\tau$ is the torque (N$\cdot$m) applied by the platform to the gimbal

The following variable is also a function of time, although you may assume that it is constant (a low-level controller was designed and implemented for you that tries to ensure this is true):

* $v_\text{rotor} = 1000$ is the angular velocity (rad/s) of the rotor

All other parameters are constant:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_1 &= - J_{3y} + 2 J_{3z} \\
a_2 &= 2 J_{3y} \\
a_3 &= - 2 g m r \\
a_4 &= 2 J_{1z} + 2 J_{2z} + 2 m r^{2} \\
a_5 &= 2 J_{3z} \\
a_6 &= \frac{J_{3y} - J_{3z}}{2 \left(J_{2x} + J_{3x}\right)} \\
a_7 &= - \frac{J_{3y}}{J_{2x} + J_{3x}} \\
a_8 &= \frac{1}{J_{2x} + J_{3x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

These parameters are defined in terms of the following quantities:

* $J_{1z} = 0.5\;\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^2$, one principal moment of inertia of the platform
* $J_{2x} = J_{2z} = 0.001\;\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^2$, two principal moments of inertia of the gimbal
* $J_{3x} = J_{3y} = J_{3z} = 0.01\;\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^2$, principal moments of inertia of the rotor
* $m = 1.0\;\text{kg}$, the mass of the boom
* $r = 2.0\;\text{m}$, the length of the boom
* $g = 9.81\;\text{m}/\text{s}^2$, the acceleration of gravity

Sensors provide measurements of all angles and angular velocities. Actuators allow you to choose what torque will be applied by the platform to the gimbal, up to a maximum of $\pm 5\;\text{N}\cdot\text{m}$.

The code provided [here]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/main/projects/01_cmg) simulates the motion of this system ([CMGDemo]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/main/projects/01_cmg/CMGDemo-Template.ipynb)) and also derives the equations of motion in symbolic form ([DeriveEOM]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/main/projects/01_cmg/DeriveEOM.ipynb)).

The system starts at whatever initial conditions you choose. The goal is to bring the platform back to rest at some desired angle that you get to choose. Careful! Not all platform angles may be achievable.

### Your tasks

Please do the following things:

* Choose a platform angle that you want to achieve.
* Linearize the model about an equilibrium point that corresponds to this platform angle and express the result in state-space form.
* Design a linear state feedback controller and verify that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable in theory.
* Implement this controller and verify that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable in simulation, at least when initial conditions are close to equilibrium.

Remember that your controller is not expected to "work" in all cases and that you should try hard to establish limits of performance (i.e., to break your controller).

For example, it is insufficient to simulate the application of your controller from one set of initial conditions, plot the resulting trajectory, argue that this trajectory is consistent with the closed-loop system being stable, and conclude (wrongly) that your controller "works." Instead, you should test your controller from many different sets of initial conditions and should try to distinguish between conditions that do and do not lead to failure.

An exceptional response to this project would go beyond minimum requirements and consider a variety of other factors that might impact the performance of your controller, such as changing the boom mass $m$ or the rotor velocity $v_\text{rotor}$. (There are many other opportunities --- just let us know what strikes you as interesting.)

### Frequently asked questions

##### May I watch videos that are submitted by other students?

Yes. All videos will be available in the [AE353 (Spring 2022) Project Videos](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/channel/channelid/245771012) channel on Illinois Media Space as soon as they are submitted by your colleagues (see the [Video](#final-video-by-1159pm-on-friday-february-18) deliverable). You may watch these videos whenever you want, even before you submit your own.

If you are inspired by a video, or if watching a video strongly influences the way you proceed with your own design project, then you must **acknowledge and cite** this video in your report (and in your own video, if appropriate). Failure to do so would be considered [plagiarism](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-402/).

##### How do I get started?

The first thing you should do is [follow the instructions to download and run course code](setup), verify that you can run the simulation, and mess around a little bit with different actuator commands (e.g., constant gimbal torque) to get a sense for how the system responds. You might want to try a PD controller, as we did in class, even before you start doing any analysis.

After that, if you have read the entire [project description](#design-project-1-cmg) and are not sure how to proceed, then take your best guess and ask a question on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/GF2D039DE). Improving your ability to get unstuck by asking a good question is an explicit goal of this course.
